### Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- created retirement_titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1,1952 and December 31,1955.As I want to retrieve all records with titles table I used employees table RIGHT JOIN with titles table.

    retirements_title table:

- Then used DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee and created new table named unique_titles.

- And then exclude those employees that have already left the company by filtering on to_date to keep only those dates that are equal to '9999-01-01'.

- Finally wrote statement to retreive the number of employees by their most recent job titel who are about to retire.For that query used COUNT() on emp_no and GROUP BY title ,to retreive title wise count from unique_titles table.
