## Overview of the analysis

### Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Using the created EDR in this module as a reference and based on the knowledge of SQL queries,created retirement_titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1,1952 and December 31,1955.Because some employees may have multiple titles in the Database.So I used DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent of each employee.

Then used the count() function to create a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

Finally,because we want to include only current employees in our analysis,excluded the employees those who have already left the company.
